**Design Patterns**

1. Model-View-Controller
    * MVC is a software design pattern commonly used to develop user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements (Model, View, Controller).
 
2. Factory Method
   * Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.


**Code Smells**

1. Primitive Obsession
   * Signs: Use of primitives instead of small objects for simple tasks.
   * Refactor: Replace Data Value with Object.

2. Duplicate Code
   * Signs: Two code fragments look almost identical.
   * Refactor: Form Template Method.
